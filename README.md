Analyzing Conference Disparity in the NBA with R

This project is conducted in R using data from the 2005-06 season to 2020-21. I analyzed wins, losses, points scored, and other game stats to determine if there is a significant conference disparity in the NBA.

I also recommended machine learning models to help make data-driven decisions within the NBA. Check out the HTML file for full project!
